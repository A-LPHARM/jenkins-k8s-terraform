In this Jenkins script, we are performing several tasks to build and deploy an application using Docker, AWS ECR, Terraform, and Kubernetes. Here's a breakdown of the steps in a more understandable format:

**Step 1: Build Docker Image and Push to AWS ECR**

- We start by building a Docker image.
- The image is then pushed to an AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

**Step 2: Create AWS Resources**

Under the "CREATE ENVIRONMENT" section, we set up AWS resources:

- We configure AWS environment variables such as AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, AWS_CREDENTIALS, and PATH.
- We create an AWS ECR repository using the `aws ecr create-repository` command.
- We create an AWS S3 bucket using the `aws s3 mb` command.
- We create an AWS DynamoDB table using the `aws dynamodb create-table` command.

**Step 3: AWS ECR Authentication**

- We use AWS CLI commands to authenticate with AWS ECR from within our Jenkins pipeline script.

**Step 4: Terraform Initialization and Deployment**

- We use Terraform to initialize and deploy infrastructure.
- Terraform reads configuration files from the `terraform/ecr_registry` directory.
- The Terraform outputs (registry_id, repository_name, repository_url) are captured for later use.

**Step 5: Build and Deploy Docker Image**

- We build a Docker image from the Dockerfile.
- The image is tagged with the repository name and build ID.
- The Docker image is pushed to the ECR repository.
- We clean up by removing local Docker images.

**Step 6: Kubernetes Deployment**

- We configure the Kubernetes credentials and server URL.
- A Docker registry secret is created for accessing the ECR repository.
- We apply Kubernetes manifests (`k8sbook.yaml` and `kjavaapps.yaml`) using `kubectl apply`.
- Before applying `kjavaapps.yaml`, we use `envsubst` to substitute environment variables in the YAML file.

**Additional Notes:**

- We have defined functions for creating AWS resources (ECR, S3 bucket, DynamoDB) and retrieving Terraform paths.
- We use a Jenkins agent to run our pipeline stages.
- The Jenkins slave is set up to communicate with Kubernetes.
- We have configured Kubernetes credentials for Jenkins using `kubectl get secrets`.
- We have established a tunnel for Jenkins to communicate with Kubernetes.
- Instead of a pod template, we use a Kubernetes manifest for defining the build pod.
- The Docker image used in the build pod contains AWS, Docker, Python, and kubectl.
- The Kubernetes cluster information is obtained using `kubectl cluster-info`.

Overall, this Jenkins script automates the process of building, deploying, and configuring various AWS and Kubernetes resources for your application, providing a streamlined CI/CD pipeline.
